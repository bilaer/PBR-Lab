# PBR Lab

**PBR Lab** is an experimental/learning project focused on testing **Physically Based Rendering (PBR)** with **Image-Based Lighting (IBL)**.  
All environment maps are generated using my custom **IBL Gen** tool, which produces the **Irradiance Map**, **Prefilter Map**, and **BRDF LUT** on the GPU.


## âœ¨ Features

- **Basic glTF PBR Pipeline**
  - Currently supports the standard glTF 2.0 metallic-roughness workflow
  - Core maps: albedo, normal, roughness, metallic, AO, emissive
- **Model Loading**
  - Load `.ply` files (via Assimp)
  - Load `.glb` / `.gltf` files (via TinyGLTF)
- **Geometry**
  - Built-in primitives: sphere and plane
- **Texture Handling**
  - Manual texture binding to material slots
  - Automatic PBR texture loading from model files
- **IBL Integration**
  - Supports irradiance map, prefilter map, and BRDF LUT
  - Maps generated with **IBL Gen** (self-developed GPU-based tool)

## ðŸš€ Roadmap

- **Advanced glTF Extensions**
  - Clearcoat  
  - Transmission  
  - (and more glTF PBR extensions in the future)
- **Extended BRDF Models**
  - Anisotropic BRDF  
  - Clearcoat BRDF (custom implementation)  
- **Real-time Approximations**
  - Spherical Harmonics (SH) support for dynamic irradiance
- **Additional Features**
  - More built-in primitives and model formats
  - Improved debugging and visualization tools
